SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows you to perform operations such as:

- **Selecting data**: Retrieving specific data from one or more tables.
- **Inserting data**: Adding new data into a database table.
- **Updating data**: Modifying existing data within a table.
- **Deleting data**: Removing data from a table.

## Basic SQL Commands

Here are some basic SQL commands:

- `SELECT`: Retrieves data from a database.
- `INSERT`: Adds new data to a database.
- `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data.
- `DELETE`: Removes data.

### Example of a `SELECT` Statement

`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';`

In this post, I cover the basics of SQL, including how to select, insert, update, and delete data in a relational database.
